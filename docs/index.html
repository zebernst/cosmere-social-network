<h3>A social network analysis of Brandon Sanderson's Cosmere</h3>
<br>
<p>
    <strong>author's note</strong><br><br>
    This project is still very much a <em>work in progress</em>. I'm performing
    this analysis in my free time for my own enjoyment, so I don't have a concrete
    timeline as to when this will be completed. Both this page and the
    <a href="https://github.com/zebernst/cosmere-social-network">codebase</a>
    will be updated accordingly as progress is made.
