Kadash, did I ever tell you about my first sword trainer?</p>\n\nBack when I was young, our branch of the Kholin family didn't have grand monasteries and beautiful practice grounds. My father found a teacher for me from two towns over. His name was Harth. Young fellow, not a true swordmaster -- but good enough.\n\nHe was very focused on proper procedure, and wouldn't let me train until I'd learned how to put on a takama the right way. He wouldn't have stood for me fighting like this. You put on the skirt, then the overshirt, then you wrap your cloth belt around yourself three times and tie it.\n\nI always found that annoying. The belt was too tight, wrapped three times -- you had to pull it hard to get enough slack to tie the knot. The first time I went to duels at a neighboring town, I felt like an idiot. Everyone else had long drooping belt ends at the front of their takamas.\n\nI asked Harth why we did it differently. He said it was the right way, the true way. So, when my travels took me to Harth's hometown, I searched out his master, a man who had trained with the ardents in Kholinar. He insisted that this was the right way to tie a takama, as he'd learned from his master.\n\nI found my master's master's master in Kholinar after we captured it. The ancient, wizened ardent was eating curry and flatbread, completely uncaring of who ruled the city. I asked him. Why tie your belt three times, when everyone else thinks you should do it twice?\n\nThe old man laughed and stood up. I was shocked to see that he was terribly short. 'If I only tie it twice,' he exclaimed, 'the ends hang down so low, I trip!'\n\nI love tradition, I've fought for tradition. I make my men follow the codes. I uphold Vorin virtues. But merely being tradition does not make something worthy, Kadash.

In section 2 of the 2nd [[Letters|Letter]] from ''[[Words of Radiance]]'', the author of the letter asks if Hoid is no longer hiding behind the name of his old master. The name \"Hoid\" is likely the name he is hiding behind.\n\nHoid was involved in the events taking place before any of the cosmere's published books begin and is the second oldest character seen so far.{{wob ref|945}} He was originally human, but has changed enough that when asked, [[Brandon]] only says \"It's complicated.\"{{wob ref|6614}} Hoid is not a [[Shard]], nor is he a [[Herald]], but something else entirely.{{wob ref|8843}} He is very skilled with disguises, and the overtness of his involvement varies from book to book.

Hoid answered, \"I learned it many, many years ago from a man who didn't know who he was, Your Majesty. It was a distant place where two lands meet and gods have died. But that is unimportant.\"  His origin will be revealed in the ''[[Dragonsteel]]'' series,{{wob ref|4039}} and so it is commonly believed Hoid is from [[Yolen]], the world of ''Dragonsteel'' and ''Liar''.

His brain created [[Aspect]]s, which were compartments of his brain as hallucinations. Only he can see them, and each is an expert on one, or possibly multiple, topics. The medical community, uncertain what to think of him, label him a schizophrenic. Many psychologists have tried to analyze and write papers about him. In Legion:Skin Deep, the writer for a tabloid sends someone with a sound recorder on a blind date with him. Stephen must learn the information he needs from these aspects, even though he already knows it. Normally, the aspects can't affect him at all physically, but J.C., an aspect who 'was' an ex-special forces, is able to somehow 'teach' Stephen how to roll out of a car the proper way.{{book ref|skin deep|10}} Stephen is able to skim through a book, or listen to a tape, and though not focusing on it can create(unconsciously) another aspect with that knowledge. However, since Stephen is unable to learn from them without being close enough to physically learn from them as if they were human, he can be separated from them if an enemy knows how his mind works. Zen uses this to make Stephen lose them. She pretends that they are getting out of a car, and after Stephen lets his aspects go first, drive off.{{book ref|skin deep|18}} However, this limitation is likely only a mental barrier, since once two of the aspects have a phone(also imaginary), they can call each other and relay information to Stephen. \n\nStephen has a [[Stephen Leeds' mansion|large mansion]], with one room for each aspect, since when they are uncomfortable or cramped bad things can happen involving nightmares and aspects disappearing. These bad things also can happen when Stephen's ability to maintain that the aspects are real breaks down, such as when a person throws an ice cream bar to an aspect. When Stephen sees this, the Popsicle appears to split in two, since he still sees the real one as well as the one that the aspect catches.{{book ref|skin deep|4}} It is theorized that since each aspect has a mental disorder, if Stephen didn't have any aspects, he would have all these disorders, making it impossible for him to live in any way. When he cannot solve a problem and needs all of their help at once, he calls them into a large white room.\n\nStephen uses his abilities to solve cases as a private detective. He calls himself a specialist- one who specializes in many different areas. In Legion:Skin Deep, he is offered a job that will allow him complete financial independence, so that he no longer needs to take cases.
